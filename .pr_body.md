## Summary

This PR unifies the two nearly-identical agent skills (`gg-github` and `gg-gitlab`) into a single `gg` skill.

## Why

- Avoid duplicate maintenance across two skill trees that share the same command API
- Keep a single provider-agnostic core workflow for agents
- Isolate GitLab-only behavior (merge trains and auto-merge) in dedicated sections/examples

## Changes

- Added unified skill structure under `skills/gg/`:
  - `SKILL.md` with provider-agnostic core + `GitLab-specific` section
  - `reference.md` with unified command docs and JSON schemas
  - `examples/basic-flow.md` (provider-agnostic)
  - `examples/multi-commit.md` (title generalized)
  - `examples/merge-train.md` (GitLab-specific)
- Updated docs guide `docs/src/guides/agent-skills.md`:
  - one unified `gg` skill in table and links
  - updated file tree
- Updated `README.md` to reference the single `gg` skill
- Removed old skill directories:
  - `skills/gg-github/`
  - `skills/gg-gitlab/`

## Notes

- Command surface remains the same across providers.
- `--auto-merge`, `in_merge_train`, `merge_train_position`, and `queued`/`already_queued` land outcomes are documented as GitLab-specific.
