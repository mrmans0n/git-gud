# Command Reference

This section is a command-by-command reference based on `gg --help` and `gg <command> --help`.

Unlike the guides, this section is organized by command surface and flags. Each page still includes practical examples.

## Command groups

- Stack lifecycle: `co`, `ls`, `sync`, `land`, `clean`
- Editing: `mv`, `first`, `last`, `prev`, `next`, `sc`, `absorb`, `reorder`, `rebase`
- Utilities: `lint`, `setup`, `reconcile`, `continue`, `abort`, `completions`
